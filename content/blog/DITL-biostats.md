It seems fitting that my first blog post is on a topic that I tried and failed to find via Google search a few years ago.

I’ll back up for a second. A few years ago I was a recent college graduate, and trying hard to “figure out my life.” My major was biochemistry, which is one of those degrees where 99%* of people just keep on going to school.

I was working full-time night-shift at a hospital as a patient care technician. The key word in that sentence is “night-shift” which meant that even on my days off, I didn’t sleep at night, but all my friends and family did. So, I was often alone and awake, with a lot of time to think about my future… and surf the web for potential careers.
