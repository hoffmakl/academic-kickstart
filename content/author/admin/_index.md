I am a Research Biostatistician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. I am passionate about meaningful, reproducible medical research. In addition to my research collaborations, I enjoy teaching statistics and assist with multiple courses in WCM's Biostatistics and Data Science MS program.

Outside of work I enjoy reading, playing sports, exploring new places, and visiting my family in Michigan. Prior to becoming a statistician, I cared for patients in the hospital as a nurse tech, played collegiate softball and coached high schoolers, and wrote a [thesis](http://dspace.udmercy.edu:8080/bitstream/handle/10429/777/Hoffman_UDMHonorsThesis.pdf?sequence=1) on artists' portrayal of mental illness.
